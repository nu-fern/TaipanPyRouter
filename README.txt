<<Insert a description of this sub-system here.  Leave the lower part alone>>

------------------------------------------------

This software has made use of the ESO cmm system (known internally
at AAO as "acmm").  

This module is a NORMAL (non-drama) module - would normally be driven
by a Makefile but not necessarly so.
